mode=0
     default mode
	Apatch
	   This Manager can now operate in either OverlayFS or bind-mount (magic mount)
	   hiding:
	      overlayfs mode is nope 
	      magic mount (bind_mount_enable) mode is hideable with zygisk assistant
	Magisk, magic mount
	   Adaway compatible
	   hiding: shamiko / denylist
	KernelSU, OverlayFS + path_umount
	   no adaway compatibiliy
	   hiding: umount modules, for non-gki please backport path_umount 

mode=1
     ksu_susfs bind mode, mount --bind
        KernelSU only
        Requires susfs-patched kernel and userspace tool
     Adaway compatible
     hiding, best in its class as susfs handles the unmount
     
mode=2
    plain bindhosts, mount --bind
       actually works on all managers but not really preferrable as it leaks a global mount
    Adaway compatible
    This is selected when APatch is on OverlayFS mdoe as that offers better compatibility
    hiding: none at all
    
mode=3
    apatch_hfr, hosts file redirect
       APatch only and requires hosts_file_redirect kpm
       https://github.com/AndroidPatch/kpm/blob/main/src/hosts_file_redirect/
       doesn't seem to work on all setups, hit-and-miss
       no adaway compatibility
     hiding, real good as theres no mount at all

mode=4
     zn_hostsredirect, zygisk netd injection
     Should work on all managers, requires 
       https://github.com/aviraxp/ZN-hostsredirect
       https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ZygiskNext
     no adaway compatibility
     hiding, real good as theres no mount at all
     
mode=5
    ksu_susfs_open_redirect, in-kernel file redirects
       KernelSU only
       Requires susfs-patched kernel and userspace tool
       No way to do heuristics? (citation needed) and author discourages its usage
       opt-in only due to lack of heuristic if krenel has it
         echo "mode=5" > /data/adb/bindhosts/mode_override.sh
       Requires susfs 1.5.1 or later
     Adaway compatible
     hiding, real good as theres no mount at all

mode=6
   ksu_source_mod
      KernelSU only
      requires source modification
        https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU/commit/2b2b0733d7c57324b742c017c302fc2c411fe0eb
      KernelSU NEXT 12183+ 
        https://github.com/rifsxd/KernelSU-Next/commit/9f30b48e559fb5ddfd088c933af147714841d673
      WARNING: conflicts with susfs, you dont need this if you can implement susfs
      opt-in only (plain ksu) due to lack of heuristic if krenel has it
        echo "mode=6" > /data/adb/bindhosts/mode_override.sh
      Adaway compatible
      hiding, best in its class as long as path_umount is available

mode=7
   generic_overlay
      generic overlayfs rw mount
      requires overlayfs
      ALL Managers
      opt-in only due to high susceptability to detections
        echo "mode=7" > /data/adb/bindhosts/mode_override.sh
      Adaway compatible
      hiding: essentially no hiding, needs assistance

mode=8
   ksu_susfs_overlay
      susfs-assisted generic overlayfs
      KernelSU only
      Requires susfs-patched kernel and userspace tool
        echo "mode=8" > /data/adb/bindhosts/mode_override.sh
      Adaway compatible
      hiding: good but ksu_susfs_bind is easier

mode=9
     ksu_susfs bind_kstat mode, mount --bind with spoofed kstat
        KernelSU only
        Requires susfs-patched kernel and userspace tool
     Adaway compatible
     for people with failing mode 1, opt-in only
